## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?

The article sort of confirmed what I already thought. I will certainly have to continue to work on this, but the point is that it is more of a mindset than a goal. I will also continue to form healthier eating habits, which I have made a concerted effort at doing the last few years.

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.

Data types include:
*string - words and sentences that do not have special roles in Javascript
*number - any number, including decimals. Examples include 1, 3.14, and 2021.
*boolean - a value or either true or false.

3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?

console.log(`"Hello World!"`);

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?

//Will indicate single line comments.
/*Wrapping text in this way will comment out everything inside the wrap, including multiple lines at once.
This can be used for explaining the purpose of some part of the code for yourself and future developers. It can also be used to take a certain part of the code out of the instructions
for the computer, such as when some line throws an error when trying to run the program.*/

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?

A variable is simply a holding place for a certain value so that it can be referenced, used, or re-assigned later. To explain it to a five year old, I would say the word "age" is a variable and when I ask the kid what his/her age is, they will respond with "5", which is the value assigned to the variable "age"

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?

I use Spotify all the time. Spotify probably uses variables like: albumName, songLength, and artistName. artistName and albumName are strings, while the songLength is probably a number (I'd guess measured in seconds) that is converted into the format min:sec when displayed on the screen.

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.

Concatenation is the process of combining variables into a single string using the '+' operator.

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatenation?

Back to Spotify, the program probably uses concatenation when it says, "new release from " + artistName

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)

So, are my files in my Git repository linked to my GitHub profile? If they are local on my computer, how are they reviewed by the instructors?
