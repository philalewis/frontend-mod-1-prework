//-------------------
// PART 1: Animals: Array Syntax
//-------------------

// EXAMPLE: write code below that will log an array of animals.
// Store the array in a variable.
var animals = ["Zebra", "Giraffe", "Elephant"];
console.log(animals);

// EXAMPLE: Write code below that will log "Zebra" from the animals array
// YOUR CODE HERE
console.log(animals[0]);

// YOU DO: Write code below that will log the number of elements in array of
// animals from above.
console.log(animals.length);

// YOU DO: Write code that will reassign the last item in the animals
// array to "Gorilla"
//let removeLast = animals.pop();
//let addGorilla = animals.push("Gorilla");
animals[animals.length - 1] = "Gorilla";
console.log(animals);
animals[animals.length - 1] = "Elephant";
// YOU DO: Write code that will add a new animal (type of your choice) to position 3.
let addZebra = animals.push("Zebra");
console.log(animals);
// YOU DO: Write code that will log the String "Elephant" in the animals array
console.log(animals[2]);

//-------------------
// PART 2: Foods: Array Methods
//-------------------

// YOU DO: Declare a variable that will store an an array of at least 4 foods (strings)
var foods = ['Onions', 'Bell Peppers', 'Celery', 'Garlic'];
console.log(foods);
// YOU DO: Write code below that will log the number of elements in the array of
// foods from above.
console.log(foods.length);

// YOU DO: Write code below that uses a method to add "broccoli" to the foods array and
// log the changed array to verify "broccoli" has been added
let addBroccoli = foods.push('Broccoli');
console.log(foods);
// YOU DO: Write code below that removes the last item of food from the foods array and
// log the changed array to verify that item has been removed
let removeBroccoli = foods.pop();
console.log(foods);
// YOU DO: Write code to add 3 new foods to the array.
  // There are several ways to do this - choose whichever you'd like!
// Then, log the changed array to verify the new items have been added
let addMeats = foods.push('Sausage', 'Chicken', 'Shrimp');
console.log(foods);
// YOU DO: Remove the food that is in index position 0.
foods.shift();
console.log(foods);
//-------------------
// PART 3: Where are Arrays used?
//-------------------

/*
Sometimes we need to hold on to multiple pieces of data, but have it grouped together in a list.
This is why programming languages have arrays!

One example of a web/mobile application that uses arrays is Instagram. Each user has a set of posts
associated with their account. Each post, is one of potentially many, that are grouped together in a list,
or, array.

The post itself likely has more complex data, but here's one way we can think about it:
*/

var posts = ["image at beach", "holiday party", "adorable puppy", "video of cute baby"];

// YOU DO: Think of a web application you commonly use. Where do you see LISTS utilized, where arrays
// may be storing data? Come up with 3 examples - they could be from different web applications or
// all from the same one.

// 1: Spotify has lists of saved artists in a user's library
// 2: Rover.com creates a list of nearby dog sitters
// 3: Google Maps has a list of starred places


//-------------------
// Part 4: Don't let yourself forget everything from Section 2 of Pre-work
//-------------------

/*
YOU DO:
Using the variables defined below, write a program that will tell a user if they
will be able to call an Uber.

The user can call an uber if they have 15% battery remaining, or more. In this case, it doesn't matter
if the user has a charger at all, or what type.
The can call an uber if they have a charger and it is a car charger.

*/
var percentBatteryLeft = 16;
var hasCharger = true;
var chargerType = "wall";

// Write your conditional here

// The condition that percentBatteryLeft must be 15 or greater
if (percentBatteryLeft >= 15) {
// message if condition is met
  console.log("You may call an Uber");
} else {
// message if condition is not met
  console.log("You may not call an Uber");
};

// Use a conditional to determine whether all three conditions are met:
// percentBatteryLeft must be equal to or greater than 15, hasCharger is true, and chargerType must be "car"
if (percentBatteryLeft >= 15 && hasCharger && chargerType === "car") {
// log the message if all three conditions are met
  console.log("You may call an Uber");
} else {
// otherwise, if not all three conditions are met, log the message, "You may not call an Uber"
  console.log("You may not call an Uber");
};


// YOU DO - ANNOTATE: Above each line of your code for this if statement, create a comment.
// That comment should describe, in your own words, and as technically precise as possible,
// what the line of code below, does.

// MAKE 100% SURE that you have RUN the code in node in your command line, to ensure it works
// as you think it doesðŸŒŸ
