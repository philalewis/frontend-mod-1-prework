## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

First, the juxtaposition of a fixed mindset verses a growth mindset really resonated with me. A specific cultural example of a fixed mindset is the amount of people that say something along the lines of, "I'm not a math person." It may be true that math comes a little easier for some than others, but algebra can be learned by anyone with a growth mindset.

Second, it's important not to get trapped in a mindset of comparing oneself to a stereotype or idea of what a programmer should be. The stereotype of a brilliant programmer that just understands how to do something right away is unreasonable and that type of understanding can only be gained with many years of experience. Be easy on yourself and remember that you are new to coding. Things that seem difficult to grasp right now will become easier over time.

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?

I am and always have been dedicated to learning new skills. I have learned skills that many would find difficult. When I commit to learning a new skill, I put in a lot of work to not just learn it, but to become good at it. However, I am not great at asking others for help when I am struggling. I need to get better at listening to others, especially when they want to help me. I am working on this and I believe I am getting better about it.

1. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.

I would guess Spotify uses arrays when they construct the list of artists in the user's library. When you open your library on Spotify, you can click on artists and it brings up all of the artists that you have saved. These artists are on Spotify, but when you save it to your library, the program probably .push() the artist onto the array it has constructed for you.

1. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.

An array method is a common instruction that programmers use for arrays that have a reserved keyword in JS. For example, the .push() method is a reserved word (+ syntax) for adding a value (and index) onto the end of an array. This is a common enough instruction that JS has created a "method" so that it is easy to do.

1. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?

A loop is a way to conduct a set of instructions multiple times without having to write the instructions more than once. This can be used in conjunction with an array when you want to apply the instructions to each item in the array. We would use a loop without an array when we want to do something a certain number of times, but without a list to go through, like if we were singing "99 bottles of beer on the wall."

1. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?

A loop is like when you go around and tell everyone goodbye at Christmas (at least this is how I would explain to my niece, who is 5). You do the same thing for each person. You tell them goodbye and give them a hug. For each person you do the same thing, so your parents only tell you the instructions once, but you carry out those instructions for each person in the room.

1. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?

I really don't have any questions about arrays and loops. I will be looking up the difference between let, const, and var.
