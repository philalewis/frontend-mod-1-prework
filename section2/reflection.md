## Section 2 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?

Sometimes I ask too quickly without putting in enough work to find the answer (if I'm in a bad mood), but usually I wait entirely too long to ask because I hate feeling stupid, especially in public.

1. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node, and really sent you off to learn about functions by exploring several outside resources. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?

I was honestly very comfortable with it, but I have played with functions in JS before, so I was not really outside of my comfort zone yet. I had just done section 1 today, so running a program in the terminal using node was fresh on my mind.

1. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.

A conditional statement is one in which a set of instructions are performed when the condition evaluates to true and another set is run if the condition evaluates to false. In real life, if there is a wreck on I-35, I take Sooner Road to work, otherwise, I take I-35. In some shopping apps, such as Chewey.com, if the total price of all of the items in the cart is greater than or equal to $40, shipping cost is free. If the value is less than $40, a shipping cost is added.

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.

A way to do this is `if else` statements. The program evaluates the condition of each `if` statement in order and then performs a set of instructions (and ignores the rest of the function) when an expression evaluates as true.

1. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?

To evaluate whether 2 conditions are met, use the `&&` operator. If you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, use the `||` operator.

1. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?

The difference between null, undefined, and NaN are still a little bit murky.
